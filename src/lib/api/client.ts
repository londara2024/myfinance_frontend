/**
 * The backend's base URL. Required in production, defaulted only for local development.

 * The previous `?? "http://localhost:8080"` was a silent trap once deployed: forget
 * `BACKEND_URL` on Render and every server-side fetch quietly targets the *container's own*
 * localhost:8080, where nothing is listening. The result is a page that renders an unexplained
 * error while the logs show `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8080` — a URL nobody configured. The
 * backend had the identical bug in its OpenAPI `servers` entry, and it cost real time.
 *
 * Failing at module load instead means a misconfigured deploy dies immediately with a message
 * that names the variable, rather than half-working.
